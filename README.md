# Java-Music-Shop-App
Model a music shop tht will contain items which can be sold. These items might be instruments, which someone may play e.g. guitar, saxaphone, piano, etc, or, they might be other items, e.g. guitar strings, drum sticks, sheet music etc. Each item which can be sold will have both a price at which the shop bought the item, and a price at which the item will be sold.
